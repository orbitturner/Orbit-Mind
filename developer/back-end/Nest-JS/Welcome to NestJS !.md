# Introduction

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (the default) and optionally can be configured to use [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.


## Installation[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/#installation)

To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the [Nest CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview), or clone a starter project (both will produce the same outcome).

To scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Nest files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. Creating a new project with the **Nest CLI** is recommended for first-time users. We'll continue with this approach in [First Steps](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps).
